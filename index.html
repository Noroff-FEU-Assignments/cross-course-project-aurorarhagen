    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">To ensure that a client has a secure website, I would advise them to implement automatic logging of for users of the website so that no other person could view their personal data.
        This is especially important for handling personal details like banking info. Additionally, I would advise the client to protect themselves from cross-site scripting, which makes a hacker able to access the website’s user info by receiving the users’ cookies and then logging on to the site with the users’ info.
        To bypass this potential threat, the client can modify the user data to make it unable to run malicious scripts by sanatazing user input. Some easy ways to protect a website and its users is to employ two-factor authentication, which protects user data because you need more than just the correct password to log on to the website.
        The website should also use HTTPS in stead of HTTP, because HTTPS automatically encrypts data between the client and the server. For a client that displays sensitive data, such as credit card info, this data should not be visible to the user on the website.
        So, instead of displaying the entire credit card number, only a few of them should be visible (e.g. XXXX5678 instead of 12345678). To ensure the website’s security, it can be beneficial to pay a external team to attempt hacking the site, so as to check if there are any flaws in the website’s security messurements.
